//The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as private (cannot be accessed from outside the class). If you want others to read or modify the value of a private member, you can provide public get and set methods.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Employee {
  private:
    // Private attribute
    int salary;
    int bank_id;

  public:
    // Setter
    void setSalary(int s,long b) {
      salary = s;
      bank_id = b;
    }
    // Getter
    int getSalary() {
      return salary;
      return bank_id;
    }
};

int main() {
  Employee myObj;
  myObj.setSalary(50000,987789002);
  cout << myObj.getSalary();
  return 0;
